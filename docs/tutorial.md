# Tutorial

"Calcium" is a block editor designed to help you learn programming.
You can assemble Python-like code using blocks and run it.
Blocks for pseudocode commonly used in introductory informatics (Information I) are also provided.

## Adding a block by dragging

<img src="./images/select_basic.png" alt="Drag a block from the left" style="max-height: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

1. Click or tap "Basic" on the left.
2. Drag the "Display" block from the palette to the right and drop it.
   ::: tip
   When placing a block, move straight to the right from the left side.
   :::
3. Drag the "" (String) block into the "Display" block.
   ::: tip
   To attach a block inside another, approach from the right and move left — it helps the snap behavior.
   :::
4. Click or tap inside the "" (String) block and type the text you want to display.

<img src="./images/hello_world.png" alt="A block that displays 'Hello'" style="max-height: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

## Running a program

Click or tap the "Run" button at the top center. The screen will switch to the runtime view and the program you created will run, showing its output.

<img src="./images/runtime.png" alt="Program runtime screen" style="max-height: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

To return to the editor, press the "Stop" button.

## Differences from Scratch

Calcium uses blocks like Scratch, but it has these distinguishing features:

- It is closer to a text programming environment.
  - It focuses on algorithms and data structures rather than creating animations.
- You can use Python-like libraries and features.
  - Built-in functions and string methods similar to Python are available.
